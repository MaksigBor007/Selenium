Selenium class 3

Why do we need Xpath and CSS locator?
--developers may not provide all the locators in html
--by using Xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
--Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page
--

Types of Xpath:
--Absolute Xpath -->starts from the starting node of the html
                     it always starts with single slash /
                     e.g /html/body/div/div/div

--Relative Xpath -->starts from any node of the html
                     it always starts with //

                     Syntax for relative xpath:
                     //tagname[@attribute = 'attributes value']
                     //input[@id='email']

Identifying the elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

e.g. //a[text() = 'Create new account']

Identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

//input[contains(@placeholder, 'email')]
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

Starts-with will identifying elements by its partial starting value

//input[starts-with(@data-sigil, 'm_login_email')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0 we are using 2.0 and this method is not available.


Advances Xpath:
is based on parent and child, sibling relationships

identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g //input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img
//label[@for = 'leaveList_calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g //span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying elements by its parent:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying elements by its ancestors:
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying elements by its index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]  //not recommended to use
