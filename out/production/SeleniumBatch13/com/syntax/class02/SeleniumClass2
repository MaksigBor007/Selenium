What is a WebElement:
--anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webElement
e.g. buttons, textboxes,checkboxes,links

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a browsers
internal view of the webpage
Also called as Dev tools
Document -->a simple html doc which represrnts the page we are interesting
Model -->it is just a layout of the html

Locator
is an address or a position of a webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

8 Locators:
--ID
--Name
--TagName
--xpath
--Linktext
--PartialLinkText
--CssSelectors
--ClassName

Why do se need so many locators?
--devs may not provide all elements for all elements
--some locators may have duplicate value in different nodes
e.g Linktext and partialtext are only used for links
